# Welcome to Auth

## Getting Started

Auth is OATH2/Authentication implementation using go language. 
It's my hobby project written from scratch first started years ago. 
It originally is kept as private repo, now I changed it to public.  
It provides basic login/logout/account activation/session authentication + oauth2 features provided by Osin Go implementation. 
It can provide good starting point to write Revel goserver and structure the source code. 
It is based on Revel -- A high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/) with osin Oauth2.


### Start the web server:

    revel run auth

### Run test
    revel test auth test (TestSuite -- optional)

app

    The app directory contains the source code and templates for your application.

conf

    The conf directory contains the applicationâ€™s configuration files. There are two main configuration files:

    * app.conf, the main configuration file for the application, which contains standard configuration parameters
    * routes, the routes definition file.


messages

    The messages directory contains all localized message files.

public

    Resources stored in the public directory are static assets that are served directly by the Web server. Typically it is split into three standard sub-directories for images, CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files.

    The names of these directories may be anything; the developer need only update the routes.

test

    Tests are kept in the tests directory. Revel provides a testing framework that makes it easy to write and run functional tests against your application.
